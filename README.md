Code will be released around June 2022. 

# News
[2022/3/10]: We achieve the SOTA on [nuScenes Detection Task](https://nuscenes.org/object-detection?externalData=all&mapData=all&modalities=Camera) with **56.9% NDS** (camera-only)!

# Abstract
In this work, we present a new framework termed BEVFormer, which learns unified BEV representations with spatiotemporal transformers to support multiple autonomous driving perception tasks. In a nutshell, BEVFormer exploits both spatial and temporal information by interacting with spatial and temporal space through predefined grid-shaped BEV queries. To aggregate spatial information, we design a spatial cross-attention that each BEV query extracts the spatial features from the regions of interest across camera views. For temporal information, we propose a temporal self-attention to recurrently fuse the history BEV information.
Our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art **56.9\%** in terms of NDS metric on the nuScenes test set, which is **9.0** points higher than previous best arts and on par with the performance of LiDAR-based baselines.
